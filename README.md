# WGCNA_DEGs
This code provides a strategy for improved biomarker discovery from your transcriptomic data. It consists in building a co-expression network from an entire dataset, and only thereafter filtering by DEGs. This method can be applied in transcriptomic studies, regardless of biological system, species or question being considered.
